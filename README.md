# Round-robin Scheduling

Round-robin scheduling is one of the simplest process scheduling algorithms in operating systems. It assigns equal time slices to each process in a circular order, treating all processes without any priority. This scheduling method is known for its simplicity, ease of implementation, and fairness, as it prevents starvation (a situation where a process never gets the resources needed for execution or has to wait too long).

Another application of round-robin scheduling is in computer networks, where it is used for scheduling data packets transmitted over networks.

## Using Round-robin Scheduling for Tasks

In scenarios where task sizes vary significantly, round-robin scheduling can favor larger tasks over smaller ones since they require more time to complete. This issue can be addressed using time-sharing, where each task is given a fixed time and is interrupted if it is not completed, ensuring it gets another time slot in the next cycle.
